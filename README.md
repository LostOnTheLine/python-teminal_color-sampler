# python-teminal_color-sampler
A simple python script created to sample colors in a terminal script. Designed for use in MS Terminal on Windows 11 but should work on any with python without modifcaitons, I just haven't tested as I built it as a quick tool to use, just thought others may have use of it. Just run the script, select the colors/highlights &amp; see what it looks like
